# React Native Template

This is a simple template that shows __a very opiniated__ way of getting a React Native project up and running quickly.

The app covers:

- Global state management with [`redux`](http://redux.js.org/)
- Async requests with fetch and [`redux-saga`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
- Form validation with [`redux-form`](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form)
- Navigation with [`react-native-router-flux`](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux)

## Installation

1. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `react-native run-android` (or `ios`)
  - If it doesn't work make sure the JS server is running first with `yarn start`
